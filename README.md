## Summary: 
Three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:
1. Focus on increasing rides in suburban and rural cities.  You may consider reducing the fares in these cities to attract more riders
2. Focus on increasing the number of drivers to facilitate additional riders.
3. Consider marketing during winter months in rural areas where road closers due to snow and ice may be more common.
4. Consider marketing special ride deals to/from suburan and urban cities for work commutes and weekend events to eliminate parking issues and prevent drunk driving.
